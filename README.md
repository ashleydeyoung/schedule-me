## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```
## Usage
```
npm run start
```

## Motivation
Schedule-Me is inspired by the current pandemic known as COVID-19. As a potential business owner, I see there are new
requirements for businesses regarding the safety of both employees and clients. The nature of this application is to allow clients
to view, request and confirm appointments by viewing availability of a given business or contractor. 
With hope of omitting or limiting the number of patrons and exposure time in what is normally considered "waiting areas", we believe there will be a better chance of reducing infection rates.
